### Step-by-Step Installation Guide:

1) **Open Server Manager:** Start by opening the Server Manager dashboard. This is where you can manage roles and features on your server.

2) **Add Roles and Features:** Navigate to the "Manage" menu and select "Add Roles and Features". This launches the wizard to help you add new functionalities to your server.

3) **Select the Print and Document Services Role:** Follow the wizard steps until you reach the "Roles" section. Check the box next to "Print and Document Services" to install the PrintServer role.

4) **Configure Role Services:** Ensure that the "Print Server" role service is selected. You may also consider adding other related services like "LPD Service" or "Internet Printing" depending on your needs.

5) **Complete Installation:** Continue through the wizard and confirm your selections to install the role. Once the installation is complete, you can manage your printers and deploy new printers from the Server Manager.


## Deploying a Demo Printer with Group Policy:

1) **Create a New Group Policy Object (GPO):** Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), right-click your domain, and choose "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here". Name your GPO appropriately, such as "Deploy Demo Printer".

2) **Configure Printer Deployment:** Edit the newly created GPO and navigate to "User Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Printer Connections". Here, you can add the path to the printer that you want to deploy.

3) **Test the Policy:** Ensure that the policy applies correctly by using the "gpupdate /force" command on a client machine or by restarting the machine. Users should see the demo printer installed upon login.


## Conclusion:

Installing the PrintServer role and deploying printers through Group Policy on Windows Server 2022 can streamline your organization's printer management, reducing the manual setup required for each client machine.
