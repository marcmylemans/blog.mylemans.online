In this video we will be taking advantage of our Hybrid Active Directory / Azure Directory configuration. 


Be sure to check out the previous video where we configured the prerequisites:
[Windows 11 - Active Directory - Hybrid Join - Azure AD]({% link _posts/2202-12-29-Windows11HybridADJoin.md %})
[Server 2022 - Active Directory - Importing ADMX and Installing applications with Group Policy]({% link _posts/2022-12-26-ActiveDirectoryADMX.md %})

Now we will be deploying the Office Suite (Word/Outlook/...) and Administrative templates to our Hybrid AD joined devices with intune!
