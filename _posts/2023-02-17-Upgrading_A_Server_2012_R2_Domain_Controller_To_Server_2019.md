{% youtube "https://youtu.be/61H8PYeK0sw" %}

Welcome to our tutorial on upgrading an older Server 2012 R2 domain controller to Server 2019. While the typical approach involves installing a new domain controller and migrating FSMO roles, there are scenarios where an in-place upgrade is necessary. This video guides you through this process.

### Key Steps for In-Place Domain Controller Upgrade

- **Preparing for Upgrade**: Before initiating the upgrade, ensure you run `adprep /forestprep` and `adprep /domainprep` manually. These commands prepare your forest and domain for the new server version.
  
- **Understanding Adprep**: Adprep.exe is a crucial tool for this process. It's found on the Windows Server installation disk in the \support\adprep folder. Remember to run adprep from an elevated command prompt: Click Start, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.

### Supported Upgrade Paths

Hereâ€™s a quick reference table for supported upgrade paths:
