title: Upgrading A Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller To Server 2019!
---
In this video we will upgrade an old server 2012 R2 domain controller to Server 2019. In most cases you will install a new Domain controller and migrate the FSMO roles (If you want to see a video about that please leave a comment letting me know!). But in some cases you just have to upgrade the existing server.
