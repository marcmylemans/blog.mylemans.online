Welcome back to our **Hyper-V series**! In **Chapter 2**, we’re diving into one of the most exciting parts of Hyper-V: **Setting up your first virtual machine**. By the end of this post and video, you’ll have your very first **virtual machine (VM)** up and running in Hyper-V, complete with an operating system installed and configured.

If you're following along, make sure Hyper-V is enabled on your system. If you missed the first chapter, check it out here: [Introduction to Hyper-V](https://mylemans.online/posts/Hyper-V-Chapter1/).

### **Planning Your Virtual Machine**

Before you create a virtual machine, it’s important to plan a few key things:

- **Purpose of the VM**: Are you using this VM for development, testing, or to run specific applications?
- **Operating System**: Decide which OS you’ll install—Windows, Linux, or another platform.
- **Resource Allocation**: How much CPU, RAM, and disk space will you need for this VM? (You can always adjust these settings later.)

### **Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a Virtual Machine in Hyper-V**

Let’s walk through how to create a VM using **Hyper-V Manager**.

#### 1. **Open Hyper-V Manager:**
   - Open **Hyper-V Manager** from the Start menu or **Server Manager**.

#### 2. **Start the New Virtual Machine Wizard:**
   - In **Hyper-V Manager**, click **New** in the right-hand pane, then choose **Virtual Machine**.

#### 3. **Specify Name and Location:**
   - Enter a **name** for your VM.
   - Choose a **location** for where the VM files will be stored (or stick with the default).

#### 4. **Choose Generation:**
   - **Generation 1** is compatible with older systems.
   - **Generation 2** supports newer features like **UEFI** and **Secure Boot**.

#### 5. **Assign Memory:**
   - Allocate **startup memory** (e.g., 2048 MB). You can also enable **Dynamic Memory** to allow the VM to adjust its memory usage automatically.

#### 6. **Configure Networking:**
   - Connect the VM to a **virtual switch**. If you don’t have one yet, you can create one later in **Hyper-V Manager**.

#### 7. **Create Virtual Hard Disk:**
   - Create a **new virtual hard disk (VHDX)** or use an existing one. Specify the size (e.g., 50 GB).

#### 8. **Install an Operating System:**
   - Choose **Install an operating system from a bootable image file**.
   - Browse and select the **ISO file** for your OS.

#### 9. **Complete the Wizard:**
   - Review your settings and click **Finish**.

### **Installing the Operating System**

Now that your virtual machine is created, it’s time to install the operating system:

#### 1. **Start the VM:**
   - Right-click the VM in **Hyper-V Manager** and select **Connect**.
   - In the **Virtual Machine Connection** window, click **Start**.

#### 2. **Install the OS:**
   - Follow the installation steps for your chosen OS, just as you would on a physical machine.

### **Configuring the Virtual Machine**

After your OS is installed, it’s time to fine-tune your VM:

#### 1. **Install Integration Services:**
   - Integration Services improve performance and functionality in VMs. For **Windows VMs**, they are included automatically. For **Linux VMs**, you may need to install them manually.

#### 2. **Adjust VM Settings:**
   - You can always tweak settings like CPU, memory, and network configurations. Just right-click the VM in **Hyper-V Manager** and select **Settings**.

#### 3. **Snapshots and Checkpoints:**
   - **Take Snapshots** (or checkpoints) to capture the state of a VM at a specific point in time. This can be a lifesaver when testing new configurations or updates.

### **Managing Virtual Machines**

Here are some basic tasks you’ll need to know for managing your VM:

- **Start and Stop VMs:** You can start, shut down, or pause VMs from **Hyper-V Manager** by right-clicking the VM.
- **Monitoring VM Performance:** Use **Task Manager** or **Resource Monitor** inside the VM to monitor resource usage. You can also check performance in **Hyper-V Manager**.
