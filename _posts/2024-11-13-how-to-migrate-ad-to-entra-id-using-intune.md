# Guide to Setting Up Autopilot and Migrating to Entra ID with Intune

{% youtube "https://youtu.be/xrNkSVDas5E" %}


## 1. Creating an Autopilot Profile

Windows Autopilot streamlines the setup of new devices, allowing users to get up and running with minimal IT intervention.

### Step 1: Create a Dynamic Security Group

To automatically group Autopilot devices:

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://entra.microsoft.com) and select **Azure Active Directory > Groups > New Group**.
2. Set the following:
   - **Group Type:** Security  
   - **Group Name:** `SG_AutoPilotDevices`  
   - **Membership Type:** Dynamic Device  
3. Under **Dynamic device members**, enter the following rule:

    ```plaintext
    (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -startsWith "[ZTDId]"))
    ```

   This rule ensures all Autopilot devices are automatically added to the group.

### Step 2: Create an Autopilot Deployment Profile

1. In [Intune](https://intune.microsoft.com), go to **Devices > Windows > Windows enrollment > Deployment Profiles**.
2. Click **+ Create profile** and select **Windows PC**.
3. Configure the profile:
   - **Name:** `Autopilot`  
   - **Convert all targeted devices to Autopilot:** Yes  
   - **Deployment mode:** User-Driven  
   - **Join to Azure AD as:** Azure AD joined  
   - **User account type:** Standard  
   - **Language (Region):** Operating system default  
   - **Automatically configure keyboard:** No  
4. Assign the profile to **All Devices**.
5. Click **Create**.

> **Note:** The device conversion process can take up to 48 hours. To expedite, you can manually register devices using the `Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1 -Online` script.

## 2. Migrating Group Policies to Entra ID

Migrating your Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to Intune allows for centralized management and supports devices that are not connected to the corporate network.

### Step 1: Export Group Policy

1. Open **Group Policy Management Console** on your domain controller.
2. Right-click the desired GPO and select **Save Report**.
3. Save the report as an **XML** file.

### Step 2: Import into Intune

1. In Intune, navigate to **Devices > Group Policy analytics (preview)**.
2. Click **Import** and select the XML file.
3. Once analyzed, you'll see a compatibility report.
4. Select the policy and click **Migrate** to create an equivalent Intune policy.

### Step 3: Assign the Policy

1. Assign the new policy to the `SG_AutoPilotDevices` group.
2. Review and modify settings as necessary.

## 3. Configuring Applications in Intune

Deploy essential applications to devices to ensure users have the tools they need.

### Deploying Company Portal

The Company Portal app allows users to install available applications and manage their devices.

1. In Intune, go to **Apps > Windows > + Add**.
2. Select **Microsoft Store app (new)**.
3. Search for **Company Portal** and select it.
4. Configure the app information as needed.
5. Under **Assignments**, set it as **Required** for the appropriate user or device groups.
6. Click **Next** and then **Create**.

### Deploying Other Applications

Repeat the steps above to deploy:

- **Microsoft Office**
- **Microsoft Edge**

For applications that users can choose to install:

1. Set **Assignment** to **Available for enrolled devices**.
2. Assign to the relevant user groups.

## 4. Migrating Users to Entra ID Devices

When moving users to new devices:

1. **Inventory Applications:** Ensure all required applications are available in Intune.
2. **Backup Data:** Use OneDrive to back up user data from Desktop, Documents, and Pictures.
3. **Browser Settings:** Import bookmarks and settings to Microsoft Edge and enable synchronization.
4. **Assign User to Device:** Use Autopilot to assign the user to the new device.

### **Device Setup Process**

Before setting up the device, you’ll need to gather the necessary hardware information to register it in Intune. We’ll be using the **Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo** PowerShell script for this process.

Here’s how to get the devices ready for Intune:

---

#### **Step 1: Install the Windows AutoPilot Info Script**
The **Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo** script is available on the PowerShell Gallery. Follow these steps to install it:

1. Open **PowerShell** as an administrator.
2. Run the following command to install the script:
   ```powershell
   Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo
   ```
3. When prompted to trust the repository, type Y to confirm.

The script will now be installed in the default PowerShell scripts directory:

  ```plaintext
  cd "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts"
  ```

#### **Step 2: Use the Script to Gather Device Info**

Once the script is installed, you can use it to gather the hardware hash and device information for Autopilot registration. You have two options:

1. **Import a Single Device**  
   For this demonstration, we’ll focus on gathering information for a single device and importing it directly into Intune.

   - Run the following command:
     ```powershell
     WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -Online
     ```
   > **Note:** If you encounter an error saying that scripts are not allowed to run, you can temporarily allow scripts by running the following command:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```


   - This command uploads the device’s hardware hash directly to Intune using your authenticated session.

1. **Gather Information for Multiple Devices**  
   If you need to gather hardware information for multiple devices over the network, you can use the `Get-ADComputer` cmdlet to retrieve a list of devices and pipe that into the **Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo** script.

   - Use the following command to gather information for multiple devices and export it to a CSV file:
     ```powershell
     Get-ADComputer -Filter * | .\GetWindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -OutputFile .\MyComputers.csv
     ```
   - To enable this method, you’ll need to ensure the appropriate firewall rules are activated on the target devices. Specifically, enable the following rules in the firewall settings:
     - **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In)**  
     - **Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)**  

   > **Note:** This method is ideal for bulk device setup but requires network configuration and elevated permissions.

#### **Step 3: Device Setup Process**

Once the device has been registered in Intune, proceed with the following steps:

1. **Connect the Device to the Internet**  
   - Use Ethernet or configure Wi-Fi during the initial setup process.

2. **Sign in with the User's Work Account**  
   - When prompted, the user signs in with their organizational account (e.g., their Microsoft 365 credentials).

3. **Configure Windows Hello**  
   - The user sets up Windows Hello, which can include a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition, depending on the device’s capabilities.

4. **Automatic Policy and Application Deployment**  
   - After signing in, the device setup will complete automatically.  
   - Company policies and applications are deployed to the device as configured in Intune.
