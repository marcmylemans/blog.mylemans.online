---

{% youtube "https://youtu.be/FDcCoxioSp8" %}

Welcome to a crucial troubleshooting guide for Windows 11 users. In this video, we tackle a specific issue faced by many using Windows 11 22H2: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connectivity problems. We'll guide you through creating a targeted Group Policy to resolve these issues effectively.

### What We Cover in This Tutorial

This video is designed to provide a comprehensive solution to the RDP issues in Windows 11 22H2, focusing on:

1. **Creating a Specific Group Policy**: We'll show you how to set up a Group Policy that forces RDP clients to use TCP instead of UDP.
2. **Implementing WMI Filters**: To ensure this policy only applies to affected Windows 11 22H2 devices, we use WMI Filters for precision targeting.
3. **Manual Registry Edit**: Step-by-step instructions on how to disable UDP connections via the Windows Registry.

### The Issue at Hand

The 22H2 update for Windows 11 introduced a bug affecting RDP performance. While UDP is typically faster than TCP for RDP connections, this bug necessitates a temporary shift to TCP to ensure stable and reliable remote desktop sessions.

### Implementing the Fix

We will guide you through:

- **Setting up the Group Policy**: Utilizing WMI Filters to specifically target Windows 11 22H2 devices.
- **Registry Modification**: 
    ```plaintext
    Path: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\Client
    Entry: fClientDisableUDP (DWORD)
    Value: 1
    ```
    This registry edit disables UDP in RDP, reverting to TCP, and requires a device restart for changes to take effect.

### Additional Resources

### Concluding Thoughts

Troubleshooting and adapting to software updates are key skills in IT management. This tutorial provides a specific solution to enhance your Windows 11 22H2 experience, ensuring your RDP connections remain stable and efficient.

We look forward to your feedback and experiences after implementing this fix. Your insights contribute to a growing knowledge base for the Windows 11 community.
