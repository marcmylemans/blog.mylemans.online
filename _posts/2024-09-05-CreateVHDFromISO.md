## Follow-Up: Enhancing the Hyper-V Automation Project with TemplateBuilder

As a follow-up to the initial Hyper-V Automation Project, I'm excited to introduce a new addition to the project: the **TemplateBuilder**. This new script, included under the `TemplateBuilder` folder, simplifies the process of creating Hyper-V templates even further. 

### What's New?

The TemplateBuilder script now includes:
- **Automated ISO to VHD(X) Conversion:** Using the powerful [Convert-WindowsImage](https://github.com/x0nn/Convert-WindowsImage) script, the TemplateBuilder automates the conversion of Windows Server ISO files to VHD(X).
- **Integrated Answer File Handling:** The script injects an `unattend.xml` file directly into the VHD(X), allowing for a fully automated Windows setup.
- ** Enables the NetFx3 feature by default.

### Simplified Setup

All necessary files, including `Convert-WindowsImage.ps1` and the `unattend.xml` file, are included within the project under the `TemplateBuilder` folder. This means you have everything you need to run the script out of the box, without having to download additional components.

### Key Benefits

- **Time Savings:** Automate the repetitive task of VHD(X) creation and configuration.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that all your VMs are set up in a consistent manner, reducing the risk of configuration errors.
- **Ease of Use:** The process is streamlined, requiring minimal input once the initial configuration is set.

### How to Get Started

To get started with the new TemplateBuilder script, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [Hyper-V Automation Project](https://github.com/marcmylemans/HomeLab).
2. Navigate to the `TemplateBuilder` folder.
3. Ensure your configuration variables are set correctly in the script.
4. Run the script in PowerShell.

By incorporating these new features, the Hyper-V Automation Project continues to evolve, making it easier and more efficient to manage your Hyper-V environment. I encourage you to try out the new TemplateBuilder, provide feedback, and contribute to the project.

### Variables

Adjust the following variables in the script as per your environment:
- `$isoPath`: Path to the Windows Server ISO file.
- `$vhdPath`: Path where the resulting VHD(X) will be saved.
- `$unattendPath`: Path to the `unattend.xml` file.
- `$Edition`: Edition of Windows Server to be installed (e.g., "Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience)"). If omitted and more than one image is available, all images are listed.

# Conclusion

The addition of the TemplateBuilder to the Hyper-V Automation Project represents another step towards simplifying Hyper-V management. With these tools, you can automate more tasks, save time, and ensure consistent, reliable VM setups.
