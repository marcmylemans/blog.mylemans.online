# Migrating to a New Domain Controller: A Smooth Transition Guide

Migrating to a new domain controller might sound like a daunting task, but with the right steps and some preparation, you can make it a seamless process. Follow this guide to ensure everything runs smoothly!

## 1. Pre-Migration Checks: Get Ready Before You Start

Before you jump into the migration, it’s important to do a few checks to ensure everything’s good to go:

- **Check the functional level of the old domain controller** — make sure it’s supported!
- If you’re still using **FRS** (File Replication Service), it’s time to upgrade to **DFSR** (Distributed File System Replication) for **SYSVOL**. Remember, this requires a **domain functional level of 2008 or higher**.

### How to Check the Forest Functional Level

You can check your forest functional level using a simple PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-ADForest | fl Name,ForestMode
```

### Raising the Forest Functional Level

If your forest functional level needs an upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Open **Administrative Tools** from the Start menu.
2. Launch **Active Directory Domains and Trusts**.
3. Right-click **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** in the left pane and choose **Raise Forest Functional Level**.

### Raising the Domain Functional Level

Need to raise the domain functional level? No problem:

1. Open **Active Directory Domains and Trusts** from **Administrative Tools**.
2. Right-click the domain in the console tree, then select **Raise Domain Functional Level**.
3. Choose the appropriate level from the list and click **Raise**.

> **Tip:** Speed up replication across your domain by running this command:
> ```powershell
> Repadmin /syncall /force /APed
> ```

## 2. Migrate SYSVOL from FRS to DFSR: Step-by-Step

Now that you’ve confirmed your domain is ready, it’s time to migrate SYSVOL from **FRS** to **DFSR**. Let’s break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Check SYSVOL Status

First, ensure that **SYSVOL** is shared and healthy. You can confirm this with:

```powershell
Dcdiag /e /test:sysvolcheck /test:advertising
```

### Step 2: Migrate to the Prepared State

Once everything checks out, start migrating to the **Prepared** state:

```powershell
Dfsrmig /setglobalstate 1
```

Now, wait until all Domain Controllers are in the **Prepared** state. You can monitor the migration status with:

```powershell
Dfsrmig /getmigrationstate
```

### Step 3: Migrate to the Redirected State

Once you’re ready, migrate to the **Redirected** state:

```powershell
Dfsrmig /setglobalstate 2
```

Wait until all Domain Controllers are in the **Redirected** state. Again, check the status with:

```powershell
Dfsrmig /getmigrationstate
```

### Step 4: Migrate to the Eliminated State

Finally, migrate to the **Eliminated** state:

```powershell
Dfsrmig /setglobalstate 3
```

Once all Domain Controllers are in this state, the SYSVOL migration to DFSR is complete!

## 3. Installing Active Directory on the New Server

With SYSVOL now migrated and your domain controller at the correct functional level, it’s time to install Active Directory on your new server.

1. Install the **Active Directory Domain Services** (AD DS) role.
2. Promote the new server to a domain controller and add it to your existing forest.

## 4. Transfer FSMO Roles: Handing Over Responsibilities

Planning to decommission your old domain controller? You’ll need to transfer the **FSMO (Flexible Single Master Operation) roles** to your new server. Typically, these five roles are held by the first domain controller in your forest root domain.

### How to Check FSMO Roles

#### Domain-Level FSMO Roles:

```powershell
Get-ADDomain | select InfrastructureMaster, PDCEmulator, RIDMaster
```

#### Forest-Level FSMO Roles:

```powershell
Get-ADForest | select DomainNamingMaster, SchemaMaster
```

### How to Transfer FSMO Roles

Ready to move the FSMO roles? Here’s what you need to do:

#### Transfer the PDC Emulator Role:

```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "dc2" PDCEmulator
```

#### Transfer the RID Master Role:

```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "dc2" RIDMaster
```

#### Transfer the Infrastructure Master Role:

```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "dc2" InfrastructureMaster
```

#### Transfer the Domain Naming Master Role:

```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "dc2" DomainNamingMaster
```

#### Transfer the Schema Master Role:

```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "dc2" SchemaMaster
```

## 5. Finalizing the Migration: Wrapping Things Up

Once the FSMO roles have been successfully transferred and your new server is up and running as the primary domain controller, you’re almost there. At this point, you can safely decommission your old server if necessary.

By following this step-by-step guide, you'll ensure a smooth and successful migration to your new domain controller, keeping your Active Directory environment healthy and secure!
