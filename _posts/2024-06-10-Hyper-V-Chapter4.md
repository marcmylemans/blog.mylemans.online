Welcome back to our **Hyper-V series**! In **Chapter 4**, we’ll dive into **storage in Hyper-V** and everything you need to know about **Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs)**. We’ll cover the different types of VHDs, how to create and manage them, and some best practices for configuring and optimizing storage in your Hyper-V environment.

If you missed the earlier chapters, check them out here: [Chapter 1: Introduction to Hyper-V](https://mylemans.online/posts/Hyper-V-Chapter1/), [Chapter 2: Setting Up Your First VM](https://mylemans.online/posts/Hyper-V-Chapter2/), and [Chapter 3: Networking in Hyper-V](https://mylemans.online/posts/Hyper-V-Chapter3/).

### **Understanding Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs)**

In Hyper-V, **Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs)** act as the virtual storage drives for your virtual machines (VMs). Everything from the operating system to the applications and data is stored in these VHDs.

There are **two main types** of VHD formats:

#### 1. **VHD (Virtual Hard Disk):**
   - The older format, compatible with legacy Hyper-V environments and other virtualization platforms.
   - Maximum disk size: **2 TB**.

#### 2. **VHDX (Virtual Hard Disk Extended):**
   - The newer format, introduced in Windows Server 2012, which offers better performance, larger storage capacity, and increased reliability.
   - Supports disk sizes up to **64 TB**.
   - Provides better resilience against data corruption during power outages.

### **Creating and Managing Virtual Hard Disks in Hyper-V**

Let’s walk through how to create and manage VHDs in Hyper-V:

#### **Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a New VHD**

1. **Open Hyper-V Manager:**
   - Start by opening **Hyper-V Manager** from the Start menu or **Server Manager**.

2. **Access the New Virtual Hard Disk Wizard:**
   - In the right-hand pane, click **New**, then select **Hard Disk**.

3. **Select Disk Format:**
   - Choose either **VHD** (for older systems) or **VHDX** (for larger, modern environments).

4. **Choose Disk Type:**
   - **Fixed Size**: Allocates the entire disk size immediately (better performance).
   - **Dynamically Expanding**: Expands as data is added, using disk space only when needed.
   - **Differencing Disk**: Tracks changes from a parent disk, useful for test environments.

5. **Specify Name and Location:**
   - Enter a **name** for the VHD and select the **location** to store the disk.

6. **Specify Disk Size:**
   - Set the **maximum size** for the virtual hard disk (e.g., 50 GB).

7. **Complete the Wizard:**
   - Review your settings and click **Finish**.

### **Attaching a VHD to a Virtual Machine**

Once you’ve created a VHD, you can attach it to a VM for storage:

#### **Step-by-Step Guide: Attaching a VHD to a VM**

1. **Open VM Settings:**
   - In **Hyper-V Manager**, right-click your VM and select **Settings**.

2. **Add a Hard Drive:**
   - In the left-hand pane, select **SCSI Controller** or **IDE Controller**, then click **Add** next to **Hard Drive**.

3. **Select Virtual Hard Disk:**
   - Browse and select the **VHD** you created earlier.

4. **Apply and Save:**
   - Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.

### **Managing VHD Storage in Hyper-V**

You might need to expand or modify your VHDs as your virtual environment grows. Here’s how:

#### **Expanding a VHD**

1. **Open Hyper-V Manager:**
   - In the right-hand pane, click **Edit Disk**.

2. **Select the VHD:**
   - Browse to the VHD file and select **Expand**.

3. **Enter the New Size:**
   - Enter the new, larger size for your virtual disk (e.g., increase from 50 GB to 100 GB).

4. **Complete the Wizard:**
   - Review your settings and click **Finish**.

#### **Extend Volume Inside the VM**

After expanding the VHD, you’ll also need to extend the volume inside the VM:

1. **Open Disk Management:**
   - Inside the VM, open **Disk Management** (search for it in the Start menu).

2. **Extend Volume:**
   - Right-click the volume and select **Extend Volume** to use the newly expanded space.

### **Backup and Restore of VHDs**

Backing up your VHDs is crucial for protecting your data. Here are some best practices:

#### **Backup Options:**

- **Windows Server Backup**: A built-in tool to back up Hyper-V VMs and their VHDs.
- **Third-Party Solutions**: Tools like **Veeam**, **Acronis**, and **Altaro VM Backup** offer robust backup solutions with additional features like deduplication and cloud storage.

#### **Restoring a VHD from Backup:**

1. Use your backup software to **restore the VHD**.
2. **Reattach the VHD** to your VM in **Hyper-V Manager**.

### **Best Practices for Managing Storage in Hyper-V**

#### **Separate OS and Data VHDs:**
   - Store the **operating system** and **user data** on separate VHDs to improve performance and make management easier.

#### **Use VHDX for Newer VMs:**
   - **VHDX** provides better resilience and performance, making it the preferred format for modern virtual environments.

#### **Monitor Disk Performance:**
   - Use **Performance Monitor** to keep an eye on disk I/O and resource usage, especially in high-demand environments.
