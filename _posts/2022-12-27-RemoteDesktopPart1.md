Join us in the first part of our comprehensive series on deploying Remote Desktop Services (RDS) in Windows Server 2022. This tutorial is designed for IT professionals looking to set up a robust RDS environment in their network.

### Deploying Key RDS Components

In Part 1 of this series, we focus on setting up the fundamental components of RDS:

1. **Remote Desktop Broker**: The central hub that manages RDS connections.
2. **Remote Desktop Host**: The server where your applications and resources run.
3. **Web Access and Gateway**: Enabling remote access to your RDS environment via the web.

### Prerequisites for Deployment

Before diving into the setup, ensure you have the following:

- **Two Domain-Joined Servers (Virtual Machines)**: These will serve as the backbone of your RDS setup.
- **Public Domain Name**: Essential for accessing your RDS environment externally.
- **Public Certificate**: We use a Let's Encrypt certificate for our lab, but a paid certificate is recommended for production environments.
- **Network Configuration**: One server will host the Broker/Web Access/Gateway services and will require a fixed IP with ports 80 and 443 forwarded to it in your router/firewall.

### Setting Up Your RDS Environment

This video will guide you through each step of the process, from initial server setup to configuring each RDS component. We'll cover:

- **Broker/Web Access and Gateway Server Setup**: How to configure and optimize your first server for these roles.
- **RDS Host Configuration**: Setting up your second server to host your remote desktop sessions.

### Why RDS?

Remote Desktop Services in Server 2022 offers:

- **Flexibility**: Access your applications and data from anywhere.
- **Scalability**: Easily adjust to changing workloads and user numbers.
- **Security**: Centralized control over access and data.
