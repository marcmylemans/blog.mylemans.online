Welcome to Part 1 of our series on setting up **Remote Desktop Services (RDS)** in Windows Server 2022! Whether you're just getting started or want to brush up on the fundamentals, this guide will walk you through the key components needed to build a solid RDS environment.

---

### **Deploying Key RDS Components**

In Part 1, we focus on setting up the core components of RDS, which include:

1. **Remote Desktop Broker**: The central hub that manages RDS connections.
2. **Remote Desktop Host**: The server where your applications and resources will run.
3. **Web Access and Gateway**: Enabling remote access to your RDS environment via the web.

---

### **Prerequisites for Deployment**

Before diving into the setup, make sure you have the following in place:

- **Two Domain-Joined Servers (Virtual Machines)**: These will serve as the backbone of your RDS setup.
- **Public Domain Name**: This is essential for accessing your RDS environment externally.
- **Public Certificate**: In this tutorial, we use a Let's Encrypt certificate for our lab, but you may want to use a paid certificate for production environments.
- **Network Configuration**: One server will host the **Broker/Web Access/Gateway services** and will require a fixed IP with ports 80 and 443 forwarded in your router/firewall.

### **Setting Up Your RDS Environment**

This video will guide you through each step of the process, from the initial server setup to configuring each core RDS component. You’ll learn how to:

- **Broker/Web Access and Gateway Server Setup**: Configure and optimize your first server for these roles.
- **RDS Host Configuration**: Set up your second server to host remote desktop sessions for users.

### **Why Use Remote Desktop Services?**

Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server 2022 offers several key benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Access applications and data from anywhere.
- **Scalability**: Easily adjust to changing workloads and user numbers.
- **Security**: Maintain centralized control over access and data while ensuring high levels of security.
