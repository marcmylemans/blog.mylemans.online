Recently, I encountered a disk space issue on a file server where the **System Volume Information** folder was occupying a significant amount of space due to DFS (Distributed File System) caching. During the initial migration to the new file server, a large cache size had been set for DFS. However, now that the files are more static, such a large cache is no longer necessary, but DFS continues to reserve this space.

To help others reclaim this lost storage, here's a streamlined guide on how to clean up DFS cache, specifically targeting the **ConflictAndDeleted** folder, which can accumulate excessive data. 

## Steps to Clean Up the ConflictAndDeleted Folder

In my case, I needed to lower the **Conflict and Deleted Quota** first. Here is a screenshot within the **DFS Management Interface**. Right-click the member, select properties, and go to the **Advanced Tab**:

### Using WMI for a Quick Cleanup

Instead of going through the more disruptive process of lowering the quota and restarting the DFS services, you can clean up the **ConflictAndDeleted** folder quickly using **WMI**. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**  
   On your DFSR server, open a Command Prompt with administrator privileges.

2. **Obtain the Replicated Folder GUID**  
   Run the following command to get the GUID of the replicated folder:

```
WMIC.EXE /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path dfsrreplicatedfolderconfig get replicatedfolderguid,replicatedfoldername
```

Clean the ConflictAndDeleted Folder
Now, run the following command, replacing <RF GUID> with the actual GUID of your replicated folder:

```cmd
WMIC.EXE /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path dfsrreplicatedfolderinfo where "replicatedfolderguid='<RF GUID>'" call cleanupconflictdirectory
```

This process will empty the **ConflictAndDeleted** folder, and the ConflictAndDeletedManifest.xml file will be removed, freeing up disk space.

Example:

```
WMIC.EXE /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path dfsrreplicatedfolderinfo where "replicatedfolderguid='08D61A29-D8C0-4559-BF43-FAC137DAD46C'" call cleanupconflictdirectory
```

By following these methods, you can effectively reclaim the storage being consumed by outdated DFS cache and deleted files. If your file server is static, this can be a significant space saver.
