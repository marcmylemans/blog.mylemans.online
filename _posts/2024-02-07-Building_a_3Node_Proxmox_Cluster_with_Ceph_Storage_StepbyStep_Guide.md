In today's video, we dive into the world of virtualization by setting up a robust 3-node Proxmox VE cluster integrated with Ceph storage. Whether you're a network enthusiast or diving into infrastructure management, this guide is designed to help you understand and implement a high-availability cluster from scratch.

Special Note:
This video marks the debut of my brand new microphone for voiceovers. I've aimed for clearer and more engaging audio quality to enhance your learning experience. I hope you enjoy the improved sound! Let me know your thoughts in the comments below, and if you miss the robot voice, I might bring it back for future videos.

Your Feedback Matters:
Your input is invaluable to me. If you have any questions, suggestions, or topics you want me to cover in future videos, please leave a comment. Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more tutorials on Proxmox, Ceph, and other network and infrastructure technologies.
