# Customizing the Microsoft Deployment Server!

## Introduction

### Previous guides:

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of adding drivers to the Microsoft Deployment Server.

## Customsettings.ini

If you followed along with part 1 and 2 then your customsettings.ini should contain the following:

```
[Laptop-True]
DriverGroup001=LAPTOP\%Model%
DriverSelectionProfile=nothing

[Desktop-True]
DriverGroup001=DESKTOP\%Model%
DriverSelectionProfile=nothing
```

You will notice that we provide a Drivergroup LAPTOP\%Model% and DESKTOP\%model% for [Laptop-True] and [Destkop-True].
This will tell the deployment process to look for drivers corresponding to the model in the following folders.

## Drivers:

To find out what the exact model name is for your laptop and or computer, you can run the following command in cmd:

```
wmic computersystem get model
```

After this you create a subfolder under LAPTOP or DESKTOP with that exact name and import your drivers in that folder.

You will also notice a WINPE folder, under this folder you can import all the missing LAN/Storage/... drivers that you need to start your pxe image.
If you have followed the previous guides and used the script, then this folder should also be included in the WINPE selection profile.
You can assign this profile to your boot image, this way only the important drivers will be added to your boot image and it will stay compact.

### Driverpacks

If you're managing a fleet of business devices from manufacturers like HP, Dell, and many others, you're in luck! These companies often provide comprehensive driver packs to streamline the deployment and maintenance of their hardware. These driver packs are essential tools for IT professionals and system administrators, as they simplify the process of ensuring that all devices are up to date and functioning optimally. 

By using these driver packs, you can save time and reduce the complexity of managing drivers across your organization's devices. Whether you're setting up new devices or maintaining existing ones, having access to these resources will help ensure a smooth and efficient IT management experience.

Make sure to check the respective links provided for the most up-to-date driver packs and resources for HP and Dell devices, for other manufacturers you can often find the driver packs with a quick google search for example 'lenovo driver pack'.

#### HP Driver Packs: 

HP, for instance, offers a dedicated website for downloading driver packs for their business-class devices. You can find these packs on the [HP Client Management Solutions](https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/client-management-solutions/drivers-pack.html) website. This resource includes driver packs for various operating systems and hardware models, making it a one-stop shop for your HP device management needs.

#### Dell Driver Packs: 

Dell also provides driver packs for their business devices. You can access these packs through the [Dell Command | Deploy Driver Packs](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000124139/dell-command-deploy-driver-packs-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment) page. Here, you'll find driver packs tailored to different Dell hardware, enabling efficient deployment and maintenance within your organization.

#### WinPE Driver Packs: 

In addition to standard driver packs, both HP and Dell offer WinPE (Windows Preinstallation Environment) driver packs. WinPE is often used for system deployment and recovery tasks. These WinPE driver packs ensure that your devices are compatible with this environment, simplifying your deployment processes.
