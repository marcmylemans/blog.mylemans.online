In this video, we will configure a VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) solution.
We will need a Hyper-v server to host our VDI Windows 10/11 template virtual machine and VDI pool (The Virtual machines our clients connect to).

The first few minutes of the video is going to be probably too quick because we have already done this wizard in the first part of this series, I'll provide a link to it:

We will also go over the template relatively quick in this video, for more details on how to create a Virtual Machine Template, please take a look at the previous video where we create a template:

For Microsoft recommendations regarding your VDI Virtual Machines configuration take a look at:

To set up a Hyper-v server to host our Virtual Machines, please take a look at:
