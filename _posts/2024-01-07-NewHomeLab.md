# My New Home Lab Journey

Welcome to my blog where I share my journey of setting up a new home lab. This setup is a dream come true for any tech enthusiast and I'm excited to document every step of this adventure.

## The Heart of the Lab: Hardware Specifications

The core of my home lab consists of three **HP ProDesk 600 G4 Mini PCs**.

These compact powerhouses are equipped with impressive hardware and some notable features:

- **CPU**: Intel® Core™ i3-8100T
- **RAM**: 32 GB each
- **Storage**: 2 TB NVMe SSD each
- **Graphics**: Integrated Intel Graphics for efficient hardware transcoding

One of the most remarkable aspects of these Mini PCs is their **low power consumption**. This makes them not only environmentally friendly but also cost-effective to run, especially important for a lab that operates continuously.

## Setting Up: The Software Installation

Setting up the software was a crucial part of this journey. I followed a comprehensive guide to import the drivers into my Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) server. Here's how I did it:

- **Step 1**: [Driver Import Guide Part 1](https://mylemans.online/posts/MDTPart1/)
- **Step 2**: [Driver Import Guide Part 2](https://mylemans.online/posts/MDTPart2/)
- **Step 3**: [Driver Import Guide Part 3](https://mylemans.online/posts/MDTPart3/)

Following these steps, I performed a clean installation using MDT, which streamlined the process and made it highly efficient.

## Software Setup: Server 2019 with Hyper-V

An essential part of my lab is the software infrastructure. I have installed **Server 2019 Standard Edition with Hyper-V** on each of the Mini PCs. This setup allows me to create and manage multiple virtual machines efficiently, providing a flexible and powerful environment for various projects.

### Installing Hyper-V

I followed a detailed guide to install the Hyper-V role on Server 2019. The process is thoroughly documented here: [Installing Hyper-V Role on Server 2019](https://mylemans.online/posts/Server2022-Installing-Hyper-V-Role/). This guide made the installation process straightforward and hassle-free.

### Creating a VM Template

To streamline the creation of new virtual machines, I've set up a VM template. This template serves as a blueprint for quickly deploying new VMs without having to configure each one from scratch. You can find the detailed process I followed here: [Creating Hyper-V VM Templates](https://mylemans.online/posts/Server2022-Hyper-V-VirtualMachineTemplates/). This approach saves a significant amount of time and ensures consistency across various VM deployments.

## Network Configuration: The Backbone of Connectivity

Currently, my entire lab network is connected via a **1 Gbit Ethernet** to a **USW-24 switch**. This setup offers a robust and reliable network backbone, ensuring smooth communication between the devices. The 1 Gbit connection provides ample bandwidth for most of my current projects, which include software development, testing, and general experimentation.

### Future Expansion Plans: Embracing Higher Speeds

Looking ahead, I'm considering an upgrade to a **2.5 Gbit network**. This would significantly enhance data transfer speeds, making my lab more suitable for higher-end tasks that require faster networking, such as large-scale simulations or intensive data processing.

The transition to 2.5 Gbit would involve:

- **Upgrading Network Hardware**: Including a new switch and network cards capable of supporting 2.5 Gbit speeds.

This upgrade isn't just about speed; it's about future-proofing my lab and preparing it for more advanced projects.

## The Future of My Home Lab

This new home lab is not just a setup; it's a stepping stone towards many future projects. I plan to use this lab for:

- **Experimenting with new technologies**: This lab will be my playground for testing and learning new tech.
- **Developing and testing software**: A perfect environment for software development and testing.
- **Educational Purposes**: I aim to use this lab as a learning tool for various IT and networking concepts.

Stay tuned as I dive deeper into the world of technology with my new home lab. I'll be sharing more updates, projects, and insights right here on this blog.

*Happy Labbing!*
