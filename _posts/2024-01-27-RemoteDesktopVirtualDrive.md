### Enabling File Transfer

First things first, ensure that 'File Transfer' is enabled when you establish a connection to your server. This feature is key to unlocking the ability to upload and download files seamlessly.

### Uploading Made Easy

Uploading files is a breeze. Just click the upload icon and select the file, and voilà, it gets uploaded to the server. It doesn’t get simpler than this!

### Downloading with a Twist

When it comes to downloading, there's a small yet important step to remember. Always use the 'Copy' option, not 'Move'. 

**Pro Tip:** After copying the file for download, click once more in the Explorer window to finalize the transfer. This small step is crucial for a successful download.
